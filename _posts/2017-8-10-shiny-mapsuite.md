Curious to see how different cartographic parameters influence your perception of the "truth" or the story that the data tells? Check out this real-time tool to manipulate some of the parameters within the [MapSuite package](https://github.com/RebeccaStubbs/MapSuite), and see how things change.

# Go see the live [visualization here!](https://rebeccastubbs.shinyapps.io/woodson_shiny_example/)

Want to explore how color choices impact your perception of county-level (real, not just simulated, like above!) socioeconomic data? Check out[this visualization](https://rebeccastubbs.shinyapps.io/color_choices_in_action/) for a time series starting in 1980 based on publically available data (intervening years between the Census/American Community Surveys have been interpolated).
